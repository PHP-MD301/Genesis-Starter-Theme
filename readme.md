**License**: GPLv2

###Description

This is my personal "starter" theme (base theme) I use when working with a project running the Genesis Framework. It is based off of the default [Genesis 1.8 stylesheet](http://demo.studiopress.com/?wptheme=genesis) by StudioPress with some minor modifications. Feel free to use it as you see fit. Obviously, it requires the [Genesis Framework](http:www.jaredatchison.com/go/genesis/). Suggestions and forks encouraged.

You may also want to check out Bill Erickson's starter Genesis [child theme](https://github.com/billerickson/BE-Genesis-Child) which is very similar.
